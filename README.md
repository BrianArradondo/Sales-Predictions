 ## Defining the causal patterns critical to sales is fundamental to success in business ##
---
### This Data is about identifying causal patterns inside of grocery item store sales as they relate to location. It is about how important differentiating the coincidental from the causal is to solving  business problems. To build a Machine Learning Model based on the Data, provides the end user actionable models to move forward and improve the business.

# Data has to be cleaned thoroughly and handled with discernment and precision otherwise the consequence is weak predictions and models without much value. 

##  This Data has 8,523 Rows of information sorted into 12 columns categories.
**Each row represents specific information related to one feature, for example, one row shares the Item Weight. Another shares the Item Fat Content. Each row represents a different element of the items that comprise sales in our grocery Data.**

**In preparation for Preprocessing to get data ready for Machine Learning the Data had to be:**
- Loaded and verified
- Duplicates must be dropped 
- Missing values managed with appropriate strategy
- Inconsistent values needed correction
- Data types identified

- Data must be explored

**This information gives a clear look at the items types that make up our Dataset in comparison to eachother. Taking a close look at the visuals reflecting specific categories the Dataset is comprised of offered insights into the interaction of different variables and can lead to better questions about what patterns affect sales outcomes.**

** Is there a relationship between the Item MRP and the Item Type?** 

- Does this tell us whether or not the Manufacturers retail price and the Item Type relationship affect the sales? Could there be an inverse relationship between the Item cost and its sales performance?

This information references the distribution of different items across the spectrum of items selling. 

## This information is all looked at and viewed from the lens of the business question we are working to answer and these various patterns and interactions are analyzed in order to draw actionable insights. These insights can then be mapped out and executed within projects to improve revenues, reduce waste and drive initiatives for the future of Sales. 

**All of this in then run through Machine Learning Models and the best predictive Model is then employed in order to achieve the best possible outcomes based on the data available.** 

### Scores are calculated in order to choose the best Machine Learning Model to employ.

## Based on the R2 Scores my recommendation is to use the Regression Tree Model for predicting future Item Outlet Sales Trends.
